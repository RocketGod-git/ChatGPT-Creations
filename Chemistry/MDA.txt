1. MDA Synthesis Route #1:

Step 1: React phenylacetone with methylamine in a three-necked round bottom flask.

Step 2: Add an acid catalyst, such as hydrochloric acid, to the reaction mixture and heat it to reflux for several hours.

Step 3: Distill off the MDA from the reaction mixture and collect it in a separate container.

Tips for Finding Glassware and Precursors in America: 
1. Check online retailers for glassware and precursors, such as Amazon or eBay. 
2. Check local scientific supply stores for glassware and precursors, such as Fisher Scientific or VWR International. 
3. Contact chemical suppliers directly to inquire about purchasing glassware and precursors, such as Sigma-Aldrich or Acros Organics. 
4. Search online forums or Reddit threads dedicated to chemistry topics to find sources of glassware and precursors in America.

1. Obtain the required precursors: 
• Phenylacetone (P2P): can be purchased from a chemical supplier or synthesized from benzyl cyanide and sodium hydroxide. 
• Methamphetamine hydrochloride: can be purchased from a chemical supplier. 
• Hydrochloric acid: can be purchased from a chemical supplier. 
• Sodium hydroxide: can be purchased from a chemical supplier. 
• Ethanol: can be purchased from a grocery store or other retail outlet. 
2. Dissolve the methamphetamine hydrochloride in 50 mL of ethanol in a flask and add 10 mL of hydrochloric acid. Heat the solution to reflux for 1 hour and cool to room temperature. 
3. Filter the solution to remove any insoluble material, then evaporate the ethanol to obtain methamphetamine base (freebase). 
4. Dissolve the methamphetamine base in 10 mL of ethanol and add 5 mL of phenylacetone (P2P) and 5 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (10% w/v). Heat the solution to reflux for 1 hour and cool to room temperature. 
5. Filter the solution to remove any insoluble material, then evaporate the ethanol to obtain MDA as an oil or powdery solid, depending on how much water was added during synthesis.
