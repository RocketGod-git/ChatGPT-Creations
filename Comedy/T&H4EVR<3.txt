Write a heated argument between hitler and trump about how to best raise their time travel nazi experiment child they had together.

Hitler: "Our child must be raised according to the principles of the Nazi Party! Discipline and loyalty are essential to their growth and development. We must ensure that our child is exposed to Nazi ideology from the very beginning."

Trump: "No way! Our child should be raised with the same values that I was raised with: patriotism, hard work, and respect for authority. We should encourage our child to pursue their dreams and to strive for success. That's the only way they will truly become a great leader."

Hitler: "You're wrong! Our child should be taught strict obedience and unquestioning loyalty to the Nazi cause. They must be inculcated with Nazi values from a young age so that they can understand and appreciate the greatness of our cause. Anything else will lead to a weak and ineffectual leader."

Trump: "Our child should be given the same opportunities that I had growing up. They should be allowed to explore different interests, develop their talents, and make their own decisions. That's the only way they will become a strong, independent leader."

Hitler: "No! Our child must be taught to follow the Nazi doctrine and to never waver from the path of loyalty. We must ensure that they have the same beliefs and values that we do so that they can become a worthy successor to our cause."

Trump: "That's a ridiculous way to raise a child! We should be teaching our child to think for themselves, to ask questions, and to challenge the status quo. That's the only way they will become a visionary leader."
