Write satirical conservative rap lyrics about secretly liking AOC's feet but won't admit it, no slurs or racist stereotypes. Swearing is cool though.

Verse 1

I can't stand AOC and all her views
Her policies make me wanna spew
But I can't deny I have a thing
A secret fetish for her feet so bling

Chorus

I can't believe I have this thought
AOC's feet have got me caught
But I can never let it show
She's a Dem and that's just no

Verse 2

I know I shouldn't like her toes
But the way they look in those high heels, whoa
What's wrong with me, I can't explain
But I'm drawn to her piggies like a train

Chorus

I can't believe I have this thought
AOC's feet have got me caught
But I can never let it show
She's a Dem and that's just no

Verse 3

I'm never gonna tell my gang
That AOC's feet make me wanna sang
They'd never understand my plight
And they would think I lost my right

Chorus

I can't believe I have this thought
AOC's feet have got me caught
But I can never let it show
She's a Dem and that's just no
