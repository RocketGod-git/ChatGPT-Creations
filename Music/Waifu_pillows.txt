Write satirical conservative rap lyrics about those dang waifu pillows, no slurs or racist stereotypes. Swearing is cool though.

Verse 1:
Ya'll think the waifu pillows are so sweet
But I'm here to tell ya, it ain't no treat
Them huggy pillows ain't no way to meet
Your needs, so just throw it in the street

Chorus:
Gotta keep your waifu pillows away
Don't let 'em mess with your head and your day
No more of that cuddly stuff, no way
Don't let 'em mess with your life no way

Verse 2:
Don't be fooled by their cutesy looks
They're just a ploy to steal your books
You think it's love, but it's just a hoax
That pillow won't help you make your goals

Chorus:
Gotta keep your waifu pillows away
Don't let 'em mess with your head and your day
No more of that cuddly stuff, no way
Don't let 'em mess with your life no way

Verse 3:
They may look fun and sound real neat
But that waifu pillow won't help you compete
It won't get you to the top of the heap
It's an empty promise you can't keep
