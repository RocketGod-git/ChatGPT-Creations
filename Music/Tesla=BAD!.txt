Write satirical conservative rap lyrics about them damn teslas, no slurs or racist stereotypes. Swearing is cool though.

Verse 1:
They think they're so cool, driving around in those Teslas
Like they own the world, with their high tech gadgets and gizmos
But you know what I think, it's a total travesty
Electric cars just ain't for me

Chorus:
Those damn Teslas, they be driving me crazy
Them dang Teslas, they just ain't my thing
Those damn Teslas, they ain't worth a penny
Electric cars just ain't no good for me

Verse 2:
So why do they buy 'em, what's their deal?
It ain't like they're saving money on gas or wheels
They say it's for the environment, but that's just a lie
Cause their emissions are still in the sky

Chorus:
Those damn Teslas, they be driving me crazy
Them dang Teslas, they just ain't my thing
Those damn Teslas, they ain't worth a penny
Electric cars just ain't no good for me

Verse 3:
So next time you see one, just shake your head
And keep on rollin' in your gas guzzlin' ride instead
Cause there's no substitute, for the good old internal combustion
Electric cars just ain't my solution
